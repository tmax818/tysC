# Lesson 5. Packaging Code in Functions

## Understanding Functions

- what are functions and how are they used?

### A Function Defined

- **function** - a named, independent section of C code that performs a specific task and optionally returns a value to the calling program.

### A Function Illustrated

[cube.c](cube.c) 

- local variable - declared within the body of a function

### How a Function Works

- argument - program data sent to the function

## Syntax

### Functions

### Function Prototype

return-type function_name(arg-type name-1 ..., arg-type name-n);

- function prototype - provides the compiler with a description of the function that will be defined at a later point in the program.
- function definition - the actual function

## Functions and Structured Programming

- structured programming - individual program tasks are performed by independent sections of program code.

## Advantages of Structured Programming

- easier to write, complex problems are broken down into smaller, simpler tasks.
- easier to debug
